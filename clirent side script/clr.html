 	 <P>A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. The ability of computers to follow generalized sequences of operations, called programs, enable them to perform a wide range of tasks.</p>
	 	<H3>CPU</H3> 	 	
	 	<p>A central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions.</p>
 	 	<H3>ALU</H3>
 	 		<p>An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a combinational digital electronic circuit that performs arithmetic and bitwise operations on integer binary numbers. This is in contrast to a floating-point unit (FPU), which operates on floating point numbers. An ALU is a fundamental building block of many types of computing circuits, including the central processing unit (CPU) of computers, FPUs, and graphics processing units (GPUs). A single CPU, FPU or GPU may contain multiple ALUs..</p>

  	 <H3>c</H3> 
  	 <p>C (/ˈsiː/, as in the letter c) is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended operations. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions, and therefore it has found lasting use in applications that had formerly been coded in assembly language, including operating systems, as well as various application software for computers ranging from supercomputers to embedded systems.</p>
  	 <H3>c++</H3>
  	 <p>Definition - What does C++ Programming Language mean? C++ is a general-purpose object-oriented programming (OOP) language, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, and is an extension of the C language. It is therefore possible to code C++ in a "C style" or "object-oriented style."</p>

  	 <H3>RBMS</H3>
  	 <P> RDMS may refer to: Registered Diagnostic Medical Sonographer, a credential imparted by the American Registry for Diagnostic Medical Sonography. an alternative abbreviation for Relational database management system, usually RDBMS.</P>
  	 <H3>OODBMS</H3>
  	 <P>An object-oriented database management system (OODBMS) is a database management system that supports the creation and modeling of data as objects. OODBMS also includes support for classes of objects and the inheritance of class properties, and incorporates methods, subclasses and their objects.</P>
  	 <H3>HDBMS</H3>
  	 <P>"Hierarchical model" redirects here. For the statistics usage, see Hierarchical linear modeling and Hierarchical Bayesian model.A hierarchical database model is a data model in which the data is organized into a tree-like structure. The data is stored as records which are connected to one another through links. A record is a collection of fields, with each field containing only one value. The entity type of a record defines which fields the record contains.</P>
